There are many types of intermittent fasting practices and multiple ways to implement OMAD.
Examples include having just one meal and fasting for the rest of the day or having one meal and eating limited amounts of food during fasting periods.
This type of diet creates a calorie deficit, which can lead to weight loss.
Other health benefits related to fasting include the potential to reduce heart disease risk factors, decrease blood sugar, and reduce inflammation</p><img src="이미지.jpg" width="100%">
<p style="margin-top:45px;">Eating one meal a day is a practice that many people swear by to lose weight and improve overall health. The one-meal-per-day diet is also referred to as OMAD.
Although the content and timing of the meal will vary based on personal preference, people following an OMAD diet typically restrict their calorie intake to a single meal or a short window of time.
The potential health benefits of OMAD are primarily related to fasting — restricting calorie intake during a set time period — and calorie restriction in general.
This type of diet creates a calorie deficit, which can lead to weight loss.
Other health benefits related to fasting include the potential to reduce heart disease risk factors, decrease blood sugar, and reduce inflammation</p>
